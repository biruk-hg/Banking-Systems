# Banking-Systems
This Java program represents a simple banking system with an Account superclass and two subclasses, SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount. 
The Account class includes methods for depositing and withdrawing funds, while the SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount classes extend the Account class and add specific functionalities such as calculating interest and considering an overdraft limit. The BankingSystem class demonstrates the usage of these classes by creating instances of SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount and performing various transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations. The program showcases the principles of inheritance and polymorphism in object-oriented programming.
